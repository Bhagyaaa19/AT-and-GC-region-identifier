# AT-and-GC-region-identifier
Python implementation for identifying GC-rich and AT-rich regions separately
Developed a Python-based Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to classify nucleotides of DNA sequences into GC-rich and AT-rich regions. Implemented the Viterbi algorithm to infer hidden states and extended the model to handle ambiguous bases (N, R, Y). Designed functions to segment sequences into predicted regions and output interpretable results. Demonstrated the approach on custom DNA sequences to accurately identify compositional regions.
Outcome: Successfully implemented an HMM pipeline in Python, showcasing skills in probabilistic modeling, biological sequence analysis, and algorithmic programming.
